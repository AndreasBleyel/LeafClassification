# LeafClassification
A Kaggle competition for the classification of leaf specimen. I tried to use a different approach than most of the submissions on Kaggle and build an image classificator. While examining the results, I stumbled upon an interesting fact and ended up with a deeper understanding of what multiclass log-loss in terms of ML classification means.

The necessary images to run this model can be found under [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/5408/download-all). After downloading you have to change the code respectivly.
